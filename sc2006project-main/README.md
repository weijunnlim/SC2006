 Extended reservations to other restaurants
- Extended reservations to other restaurants;<br>

- Reservation can be done within same page as search page, with a popup form;<br>

- Yet-to-do: Handlers for email, phone number, date, reservation time should coincide with opening hours<br>

-Need to think: how to fetch data from one single database, provide it to both patrons and restaurants for their "View Reservations".<br>

-Suggestions: Reviews, Reservations, to be available for participating restaurants. Non-participants can still be visible upon search.<br>
